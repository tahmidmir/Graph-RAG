## 🔥 Project: Fine-tuning GPT-2 & GraphRAG for Medical Text Processing  

This repository includes two **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects designed for **medical text analysis and improving information retrieval**.  

---

## 📌 **1. Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Skin Cancer Articles**  

In this section, the **GPT-2 model** is fine-tuned on **specialized skin cancer articles** to enhance its ability to understand medical texts.  

### **Features:**  
✅ Data collection from **PubMed** and other scientific sources  
✅ Preprocessing of medical texts to optimize model learning  
✅ Fine-tuning the **GPT-2** model using **Hugging Face Transformers**  
✅ Model evaluation and testing for generating medical text responses
